<p style="font-family:verdana; font-size:18px"class ="tab">I have a friend, her name is Kristina, she is my very very good friend.
  We used to study together in one class for many years. I love to drink beer and party with her.
  During our school years we hanged out and always had a good time together. She is very kind to
  others and i always liked to have a chat with her. Here is a picture of us having some fun on
  the graduation party :). Right now Kristina is studying in London, im very happy for her but
  at the same time i miss her every day :(. Im waiting for the Christmas very much, because she
  will come home and we will have a good time together again!!!  </p>
